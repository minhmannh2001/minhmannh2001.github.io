# About My Blog

Hello! I'm **Manh**, born in 2001, a backend developer currently working at **Viettel Cybersecurity Company**. Although I only have a little over a year of experience in the field, I've had interesting experiences with this industry. I'm not really good yet, but I still try every day and especially maintain my passion for programming.

In middle school, I really enjoyed playing games, and when I reached high school, facing the choice of a future career, I decided to study **Computer Science** at **Hanoi University of Science and Technology**. At that time, I simply thought I would learn game programming, not knowing that game programming is just a small part of the vast Information Technology field, or whether my direction would change during my studies. Now, looking back at my journey, I feel it was the right decision.

## About This Blog

I've been thinking about writing a blog for a long time, but due to laziness and concerns that I don't write well, I kept procrastinating. But then I realized: **writing is a skill that can be practiced**, it's better to just start doing it rather than keep thinking, hesitating, and with the help of AI today, I can improve my expression to make articles clearer.

The goal of this blog is to **record and share experiences, experiences, and knowledge** in my programming journey. In addition, I will also **document the process of building this very blog** (both in terms of content and technology), starting from using an available template and deploying directly on GitHub (no server needed) until I upgrade and develop more features to meet my needs.
