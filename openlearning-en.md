As someone still on a self-learning journey, I find that the Internet today is truly a huge treasure trove of knowledge for anyone who wants to learn about any field. However, among countless information, finding truly quality materials that suit oneself is not always easy.

This article compiles valuable learning resources that I have studied and applied in my journey of developing **software engineering** skills. I hope this list will help save time and effort for those looking for an effective self-learning path.
